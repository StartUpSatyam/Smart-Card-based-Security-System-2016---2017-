# Smart-Card-based-Security-System-2016---2017-
This was model for college project.

Smart Card has a chip that is made from Silicon, phosphorous, gold. This type of card can be used in ATMs and Sim Cards. The card have memory chip that is used to store data like Unique user ID and country code of origin, biometric data etc. This card can be used at entry and exit points of homes, stores and offices etc. Smart Card is used to avoid unauthorized access. This card can also be used as unique identity card like Aadhar cards and can be used as Bank's ATM cards. Earlier my team thought to patent this idea but we got lazy and involved in academics and later we forgot and dropped this idea.
